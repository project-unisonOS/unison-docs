# Project Unison – System Architecture

## Overview

Project Unison is structured as a **modular, service‑oriented computing platform** designed for real‑time generation and orchestration of user experiences. Each subsystem is independently containerized, communicating through defined interfaces to ensure scalability, security, and future extensibility.

## Data Flow Architecture

### Event-Driven Communication

All services communicate using standardized **EventEnvelope** messages:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid-v4",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "source": "unison-speech",
  "intent": "user.query",
  "payload": {
    "text": "What's the weather like?",
    "language": "en"
  },
  "context": {
    "user_id": "user-123",
    "session_id": "session-456"
  },
  "auth_scope": "read",
  "safety_context": {
    "content_type": "general",
    "user_age": "adult"
  }
}
```

### Request Flow

1. **Input Processing**
   - User interaction captured by I/O module
   - Intent extracted and normalized
   - Context enriched with user state

2. **Orchestration**
   - Event received by orchestrator
   - Policy evaluated for safety and permissions
   - Skills selected and dispatched

3. **Generation**
   - Skills process request with context
   - Inference services called for AI tasks
   - Results aggregated and formatted

4. **Response**
   - Policy validation of generated content
   - Response rendered through appropriate I/O
   - Context updated with new state

## Security Architecture

### Network Segmentation

The system uses multiple isolated networks for defense-in-depth:

- **Public Network** (172.20.0.0/24): API gateway and external access
- **Internal Network** (172.21.0.0/24): Service-to-service communication
- **Data Network** (172.22.0.0/24): Storage and database services
- **Auth Network** (172.23.0.0/24): Authentication and Redis
- **Inference Network** (172.24.0.0/24): AI/ML services

### Authentication Flow

1. **User Authentication**
   - Credentials validated against auth service
   - JWT tokens issued with appropriate claims
   - Tokens signed with service-specific secrets

2. **Service Authentication**
   - Service-to-service calls use client credentials
   - Mutual TLS for sensitive communications
   - Rate limiting and quota enforcement

3. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Policy evaluation for each request
   - Attribute-based access control (ABAC) support

### Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all network communication
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for stored data
- **Token Security**: Short-lived access tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event tracking

## Deployment Architecture

### Container-Based Deployment

All services run in Docker containers with:
- Minimal base images for security
- Non-root user execution
- Read-only filesystems where possible
- Resource limits and constraints
- Health checks and graceful shutdown

### Orchestration Patterns

#### Development
```yaml
# Simple docker-compose for local development
services:
  orchestrator:
    build: ../unison-orchestrator
    ports: ["8080:8080"]
    environment:
      - LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

#### Production
```yaml
# Security-hardened with network segmentation
services:
  orchestrator:
    build: ../unison-orchestrator
    networks: [internal]
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits: { cpus: '1', memory: '1G' }
    security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]
```

### API Gateway

Kong API gateway provides:
- Single entry point for external traffic
- JWT authentication enforcement
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Request/response transformation
- Security headers injection
- Service discovery and load balancing

## Scalability Architecture

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Stateless Services**: Orchestrator, policy, auth services scale horizontally

- **Inference Services**: Auto-scaling based on demand
- **I/O Services**: Geographic distribution for latency

### Performance Optimization

- **Caching**: Redis for session data and frequent queries
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections to external services
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking I/O throughout the stack
- **Resource Management**: CPU and memory limits per service

## Reliability Architecture

### High Availability

- **Redundancy**: Multiple instances of critical services
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and monitoring
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback behaviors for service failures
