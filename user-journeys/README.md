# Project Unison – User Journeys

## Purpose
The user journey documents illustrate how people experience Unison in real scenarios.  
Each journey follows a natural conversation or task, showing how Unison’s modular architecture — Orchestrator, Context, Storage, Policy, and I/O agents — works together to deliver adaptive, trustworthy experiences.

These narratives bridge design and engineering: they express *how Unison feels* to a person and *how the system behaves* internally.

## How to Use These Documents
- **For designers:** Define tone, pacing, and accessibility of human–system interaction.  
- **For engineers:** Map real experiences to technical flows and EventEnvelope sequences.  
- **For partners:** Visualize the product value of adaptive, context-driven computing.  

Each journey aligns with Unison’s vision: technology that feels natural, transparent, and capable — not something people *operate*, but something they *collaborate with*.
