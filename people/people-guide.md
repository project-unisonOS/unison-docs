When you first start using Unison, the system will:

1. **Welcome You**: Unison introduces itself and asks about your preferences
2. **Set Up Your Profile**: Basic information to personalize your experience

I can help you with:
- Writing and editing documents

```

## Basic Concepts

### Natural Interaction

Unison understands natural language without requiring specific commands:

- **Instead of**: "Hey Unison, set a timer for 10 minutes"
- **You can say**: "Set a timer for 10 minutes" or "I need a 10-minute timer"

### Context Awareness

Unison remembers and uses context from:
- **Current conversation**: What you're discussing
- **Active applications**: Documents or programs you're using
- **Time and location**: When and where you are
- **Your preferences**: How you like to work
- **Previous interactions**: Your history and patterns

### Adaptive Responses

Unison adapts to:
- **Your communication style**: Formal or casual, detailed or brief
- **Your skill level**: Beginner or advanced explanations
- **Your current needs**: Quick answers or detailed guidance
- **Your environment**: Quiet office or busy home

## Everyday Interactions

### Productivity Tasks

#### Document Management
```
You: "I need to summarize this meeting transcript"

Unison: "I can see you have the transcript open. I'll create a summary 
highlighting the key decisions, action items, and next steps. 
Would you like it in bullet points or a paragraph format?"
```

#### Task Management
```
You: "Remind me to call Sarah tomorrow at 2pm"

Unison: "I'll set a reminder for tomorrow at 2pm to call Sarah. 
Should I also look up her contact information and prepare any notes 
from your last conversation?"
```

### Learning and Research

#### Information Gathering
```
You: "What's the difference between machine learning and AI?"

Unison: "Machine learning is a subset of AI. While AI is the broad concept 
of machines performing intelligent tasks, machine learning specifically 
refers to systems that learn from data without being explicitly programmed. 

Would you like me to:
- Explain this with examples
- Show you current applications
- Find learning resources
- Discuss career opportunities in this field?"
```

### Personal Assistance

#### Daily Planning
```
You: "What's on my schedule today?"

Unison: "You have three meetings today:
- 9am: Team standup
- 1pm: Project review with marketing
- 3pm: Client call

I noticed you have a project deadline Friday. Would you like me to 
block some focus time tomorrow to prepare?"
```

## Personalization and Preferences

### Setting Your Preferences

#### Communication Style
```
You: "I prefer brief, direct responses"

Unison: "I'll adjust to provide more concise answers. You can always ask 
for more detail if you need it. Would you like me to remember this 
preference for all our conversations?"
```

#### Work Patterns
```
You: "I work best in the morning"

Unison: "I've noted your peak productivity hours are mornings. 
I'll suggest important tasks for the morning and save routine items 
for afternoon when possible. Should I also adjust your meeting preferences?"
```

### Learning Your Patterns

Over time, Unison learns:
- **When you work**: Your productive hours and break patterns
- **How you work**: Your preferred methods and tools
- **What you need**: Anticipating your requirements
- **How you communicate**: Your language and response preferences

```

#### Visual Understanding
```
You: "What's in this image I just took?"

Unison: "I can see this is a photo of a garden with roses and 
sunflowers. The lighting suggests it's late afternoon. Would you 
like me to identify the plants, suggest care instructions, or help 
you organize your garden photos?"
```

### Integration and Automation

#### Smart Home Control
```
You: "I'm heading home"

Unison: "I'll adjust the thermostat to your preferred temperature, 
turn on the lights in the living room, and start your favorite 
playlist. Your estimated arrival is 25 minutes. Should I also 
preheat the oven for dinner?"
```

#### Workflow Automation
```
You: "Set up my morning routine"

Unison: "I'll create a morning routine that:
1. Wakes you with gentle lighting and music

Unison: "Thank you for the feedback! I'll use this to improve my 
future responses to your preferences."
```

I suggest prioritizing:
1. Complete the project proposal (due Friday)
