## Getting Started

### First Steps

When you first start using Unison, the system will:

1. **Welcome You**: Unison introduces itself and asks about your preferences
2. **Set Up Your Profile**: Basic information to personalize your experience
3. **Configure Accessibility**: Any accommodations or preferences you need
4. **Establish Privacy Settings**: Control over data collection and usage

### Initial Conversation

```
You: "Hello, I'm new here. What can you help me with?"

Unison: "Welcome! I'm Unison, your computing fabric for intent orchestration. 
I help you achieve outcomes through natural expression of goals:
- Synthesize insights from your information landscape
- Orchestrate your daily priorities and commitments  
- Generate adaptive experiences for your needs
- Coordinate communication across your networks
- Bridge your intentions with computational capabilities

To begin, would you like to:
1. Express a current goal or intention
2. Explore what's possible with intent orchestration
3. Set up your preference profile
4. Simply start expressing your needs naturally"
```

## Intent-Based Interaction

### Natural Intent Expression

Unison understands your natural expressions of intent without requiring specific commands or application navigation:

- **Instead of**: "Open the budget document and show me the summary"
- **You can say**: "Show me the current budget status" or "What's our financial position?"

- **Instead of**: "Create a new email to Sarah about the meeting"
- **You can say**: "Coordinate with Sarah about tomorrow's meeting" or "Ensure Sarah knows the meeting details"

### Outcome Synthesis

Unison generates outcomes rather than managing files:
- **Artifacts are transient**: Documents, messages, and reports are generated as needed
- **Focus on results**: Express what you want to achieve, not how to navigate to it
- **Context-aware generation**: Outcomes adapt to your current situation and needs

### Computing Fabric Paradigm

Unison acts as the UX layer over computing itself:
- **Intent-driven**: Your goals drive all computational actions
- **Application-agnostic**: No need to think about which app to use
- **Seamless orchestration**: Computing resources coordinate behind the scenes
- **Adaptive interfaces**: Each moment generates the optimal interface for your needs

## Intent and Context Graphs

### Intent Graph: Your Goal Architecture

The Intent Graph formalizes how your goals are structured and executed:

```
You: "Prepare my team for the client presentation tomorrow"

Intent Graph Breakdown:
Primary Goal: Prepare team for client presentation
├── Sub-goal: Synthesize key talking points
├── Sub-goal: Create practice scenarios  
├── Sub-goal: Coordinate team availability
├── Sub-goal: Generate supporting materials
└── Priority: High (deadline tomorrow)
```

**How it works**:
- **Goal Decomposition**: Breaks complex intentions into actionable sub-goals
- **Dependency Resolution**: Identifies what needs to happen first
- **Priority Ranking**: Orders goals based on urgency and importance
- **Temporal Planning**: Schedules goals across your available time

### Context Graph: Your Environmental Intelligence

The Context Graph fuses multi-dimensional data to decide when and how to act:

```
Current Context Fusion:
├── Sensory Data: Office environment, computer active, calendar open
├── Temporal Context: Thursday 2pm, 1 hour until next meeting
├── Preference Data: You prefer visual summaries, work best in mornings
├── Historical Patterns: Usually review presentations 24 hours in advance
└── Environmental Factors: Team is online, client materials ready
```

**Contextual Decision Making**:
- **Timing Optimization**: Chooses the best moment to execute each goal
- **Modality Selection**: Picks the optimal presentation format
- **Resource Coordination**: Aligns with available people and tools
- **Adaptive Scheduling**: Adjusts based on changing conditions

### Real-Time Adaptation

The graphs continuously update based on:
- **Your Feedback**: "Actually, focus on the financial projections first"
- **Environmental Changes**: "The client just sent updated requirements"
- **Priority Shifts**: "The marketing team needs this review by 4pm"
- **New Information**: "I just remembered we need to include the Q3 results"

## Experience Generation

### Adaptive Interface Synthesis

Unison generates the optimal interface for each moment:

```
Intent: "Show me the current budget status"

Generated Experience:
- Primary View: Interactive budget dashboard with key metrics
- Secondary: Detailed breakdown by department
- Actions: Export options, comparison tools, forecast scenarios
- Modality: Visual charts with voice explanation available
```

### Multi-Modal Presentation

Your intent determines how information is presented:

- **Visual Intent**: "Show me" → Rich dashboards, charts, diagrams
- **Analytical Intent**: "Analyze" → Detailed breakdowns with insights  
- **Communication Intent**: "Explain to the team" → Prepared summaries and talking points
- **Decision Intent**: "Should we" → Pros/cons analysis and recommendations

## Unified Communication

### Unified Messaging Protocol (UMP)

Unison revolutionizes communication by focusing on intent rather than channels:

```
You: "Coordinate with the team about the project deadline"

UMP Resolution:
Intent Analysis: Coordinate team communication about deadline
├── Recipients: Project team (5 people)
├── Context: Upcoming deadline, need alignment
├── Delivery Strategy: 
│   ├── Sarah (mobile): Push notification with summary
│   ├── Mike (desktop): Workspace message with details
│   ├── Team (shared): Project update with action items
│   └── Follow-up: Automatic reminder 24 hours before
└── Confirmation: Real-time delivery status and acknowledgments
```

### Intent-Driven Communication

Express what you want to achieve, not how to send it:

- **Instead of**: "Send an email to the team with the project status"
- **Say**: "Ensure the team knows the current project status"

- **Instead of**: "Create a group chat for the marketing campaign"  
- **Say**: "Coordinate the marketing team efforts"

- **Instead of**: "Schedule a meeting with Sarah to review the budget"
- **Say**: "Align with Sarah on the budget review"

### Dynamic Channel Selection

UMP chooses the optimal delivery method based on:

- **Recipient Context**: Current location, device availability, attention state
- **Message Urgency**: Immediate notification vs. batch delivery
- **Communication Preferences**: How each person likes to receive information
- **Consent Settings**: Privacy and contact preferences

### Delivery Confirmation

You see confirmation of intent fulfillment, not traditional inbox management:

```
Communication Status:
✅ Sarah received and acknowledged (2 minutes ago)
✅ Mike reviewed the details (5 minutes ago)  
✅ Team workspace updated (8 minutes ago)
⏳ Awaiting response from Alex (sent 1 hour ago)
🔄 Auto-follow-up scheduled if no response by 4pm
```

### Transport Abstraction

UMP seamlessly handles different communication standards:
- **Modern Protocols**: Matrix, ActivityPub, WebSocket
- **Traditional Systems**: Email (SMTP), SMS, voice calls
- **Enterprise Platforms**: Slack, Teams, workplace systems
- **Future Standards**: Automatically integrates new protocols

### Privacy and Consent

Every communication respects:
- **Consent Preferences**: Who can contact you and how
- **Context Awareness**: Work vs. personal communication separation
- **Time Boundaries**: Respect for working hours and attention state
- **Revocable Access**: Ability to withdraw consent at any time

## Personalization and Preferences

### Setting Your Preferences

#### Communication Style
```
You: "I prefer brief, direct responses"

Unison: "I'll adjust to provide more concise answers. You can always ask 
for more detail if you need it. Would you like me to remember this 
preference for all our conversations?"
```

#### Intent Expression Patterns
```
You: "I work best in the morning"

Unison: "I've noted your peak productivity hours are mornings. 
I'll suggest important goal orchestration for the morning and save routine 
items for afternoon when possible. Should I also adjust your communication 
preferences for different times of day?"
```

#### Experience Modality Preferences
```
You: "I prefer visual summaries with key insights"

Unison: "I'll generate visual-first experiences with charts and dashboards 
when you express analytical intent. I'll provide text summaries as 
secondary options. Would you like me to adjust this based on the type 
of information or your current context?"
```

### Learning Your Intent Patterns

Over time, Unison learns your unique patterns:
- **Intent Expression**: How you naturally express goals and needs
- **Temporal Patterns**: When you prefer different types of orchestration
- **Contextual Preferences**: How your environment affects your needs
