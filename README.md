# Unison Docs

Canonical workspace documentation. Navigation:

- `dev/` — developer-facing docs: specs & schemas (`dev/specs/`), architecture (overview + deep dive), safety/accessibility, setup, compatibility matrix, constraints, repo map, developer guide, and hardware guide.
- `experience/` — reserved for end-user/experience docs (to be populated).
- Root — policies and contributor info (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `MAINTAINERS.md`, `SECURITY.md`).

## Quick pointers
- Specs & schemas: `dev/specs/` (e.g., `unified-messaging-protocol.md`, `event-envelope.schema.json`, `schemas/`).
- Architecture: `dev/unison-architecture-overview.md` (high level) and `dev/unison-architecture-deep-dive.md`.
- Developer workflows: `dev/developer-guide.md`, `dev/unison-repo-map.md`, `dev/hardware-deployment-guide.md`.
- Repo roles: `dev/unison-repo-roles.md` (where to start for dev, deployment, or service work).
- Releases & branching: `dev/release-and-branching.md`.
- Safety/accessibility/compatibility: `dev/safety.md`, `dev/accessibility.md`, `dev/compatibility-matrix.md`.
- Constraints & setup: `dev/constraints.txt`, `dev/SETUP.md`.
- Policies: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `MAINTAINERS.md`, `SECURITY.md`.

Per-service details remain in their respective repos; use this repo for cross-cutting docs and specs.
