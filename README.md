# Project Unison – Documentation Hub

## Overview

Project Unison is an experimental computing platform that replaces traditional apps and interfaces with **real-time, context-aware generation**.  
It runs as a modular system of services — *Orchestrator*, *Context*, *Storage*, *Policy*, and *I/O agents* — designed to create adaptive experiences for people through natural interaction, privacy-first architecture, and open interoperability.

This repository contains the living documentation for Unison’s design, behavior, and vision.
