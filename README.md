# Unison Docs

Canonical workspace documentation. Navigation:

- `dev/` — developer-facing docs: specs & schemas (`dev/specs/`), architecture/safety/accessibility, setup, compatibility matrix, constraints.
- `experience/` — reserved for end-user/experience docs (to be populated).
- Root — policies and contributor info (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `MAINTAINERS.md`, `SECURITY.md`).

## Quick pointers
- Specs & schemas: `dev/specs/` (e.g., `unified-messaging-protocol.md`, `event-envelope.schema.json`, `schemas/`).
- Architecture & safety: `dev/architecture.md`, `dev/safety.md`, `dev/accessibility.md`, `dev/compatibility-matrix.md`.
- Constraints & setup: `dev/constraints.txt`, `dev/SETUP.md`.
- Policies: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `MAINTAINERS.md`, `SECURITY.md`.
