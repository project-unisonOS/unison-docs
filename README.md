# Unison Docs (Archived)

This repo is no longer the primary documentation hub. Legacy content has been removed to avoid drift and duplication.
Use the workspace-level docs instead:

- `../docs/developer-guide.md` — authoritative developer workflow (clone → devstack → renderer → tests).
- `../docs/unison-repo-map.md` — current inventory of repos, roles, and statuses.
- `../docs/dx-hygiene-plan.md` — open cleanup items and TODOs.
- Service-level READMEs inside each repo for API- and code-specific details.

If you still need historical docs, use git history for this repo. New docs should live alongside code in the relevant
service or under `../docs/`.
