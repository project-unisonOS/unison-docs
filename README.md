# Unison Docs

Canonical workspace documentation. This repo now hosts:

- Workspace-wide guides and DX notes.
- Specifications and schemas migrated from the former `unison-spec` repo (see `specs/`).

## Quick pointers
- Specs & schemas index: `specs/README.md`
- Constraints for consistent installs: `constraints.txt`

## Layout
- `specs/` — specs, schemas, and meta-docs for the platform.

Per-service details remain in their respective repos; use this repo for cross-cutting docs.
